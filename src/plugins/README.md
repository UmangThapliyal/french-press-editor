# Slate plugins folder

Slate plugins developed specifically for `french-press-editor` live here, as well as the imported ones which are used by default within the package.
- `index.js` concatenates all plugin collections into a single array.
- `link-hotkey.js` is a plugin function that can add a link to a Slate text string.
- `mark-hotkey.js` is a plugin function that turns Slate plain text into formatted text with bold or italic styles.
- `paste-html.js` is a plugin that preserves allowed HTML structure when user pastes HTML content, and converts the rest into either plain text.
